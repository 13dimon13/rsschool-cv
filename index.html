        <h1>My Curriculum Vitae</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Hello, Rolling Scopes, my name is Dmitry Kolosovsky.</li>
            <li>You can contact me:
                <ol>
                    <li>tel. +375-33-324-65-51</li>
                    <li>mail dimontra13@mail.ru</li>
                    <li>skype monte-kristo2712</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>For me, this is a great opportunity to learn what I like. My goal is to become a programmer. I want to work in this area and enjoy my work. I quickly learn and improve my skills.</li>
            <li>Basic knowledge: html, css, js, php, mysql, joomla, wordpress, photoshop. In-depth knowledge: SEO(Search Engine Optimization).</li>
            <li>Sorry, but the last 15 months I worked a SEO-specialist, so I don’t have code examples.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I didn’t work a programmer, so I don’t have experience in this area.</li>
            <li>I graduated from BNTU and have a degree in mechanical engineering, and also underwent retraining at “Institute of retraining and advanced training BNTU” as a programmer-web designer. Then graduated from the online school “Netology”, specializing in SEO-optimization.</li>
            <li>English is weak, but I go to courses. The test, a link to which was given in the discord, showed level A2+.</li>
